#+TITLE: Type_conversions

Type conversions happen automatically when we use an object of one type where an object of another type is expected.

#+begin_src cpp
bool b = 42; // b is true
int i = b; // i has value 1
i = 3.14; // i has value 3
double pi = i; // pi has value 3.0
unsigned char c = -1; // c has value 255
signed char c2 = 256 // c2 is undefined
#+end_src
